# Photography-design

Photography and Design is a website template made for wordpress that focuses on being the portfolio of both a company or a person working in these two media as well as one.

The website consists of 5 sections:
   . About us: serves for the presentation of the company / team, being able to detail about themselves
   . Services: is to demonstrate to customers the services that the company has
   . Portfolio: focuses on showing clients the work already done by the company / team
   . Client's feedback: it is to present what past customers thought of the work provided
   . Contact: it is used so that some customer can get in contact, both through the form, as well as through the contacts that the company / team can insert
  
Through the wordpress customizer it is possible to customize the website to meet the two types of services, photographer and design, as well as just one of these.
